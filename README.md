# The Rise of the Constitutional Protection of Future Generations

This is  the repository for the data and scripts of "The Rise of the Constitutional Protection of Future Generations" by [Renan Araújo](araujorenan.com) and [Leonie Koessler](https://www.legalpriorities.org/team/leonie-koessler.html).

We expect anyone to be able to look into our methods and replicate our findings. The main dataset is ´´constitutionsfg.csv´´. If you spot any mistakes or simply want to reach out, feel free to do so at renan.araujo@legalpriorities.org.

We are grateful for our colleagues at the [Legal Priorities Project](legalpriorities.org/) for the extensive feedback and guidance during this project.

We are also thankful to Zachary Elkins and everyone at the [Comparative Constitutions Project](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/) for giving us access to their dataset of historical constitutions, without which this project would not have been possible.
